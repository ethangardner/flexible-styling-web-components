# Flexible Styling for Web Components

This is a pared-down but realistic example of how to use CSS variables as the primary styling interface for web components in a design system. This was inspired by a question by [Igor Gonak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-gonak?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACKOE88BtMqIsCxqhzqiVUW7msvY4seL4bk&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3BF6KMhceDRnKryGoZgahe6A%3D%3D) on LinkedIn. The goal for this repo was to provide just enough code to demonstrate how I might approach authoring a design system component that allows other developers to style it, and also keep the integrity of the component intact as it's used under unknown circumstances.
